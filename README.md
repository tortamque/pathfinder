# Pathfinder

## Description
Pathfinder is an application designed to help users solve maze challenges using the <b>A-star</b> algorithm. Developed with Flutter and Dart, it offers an intuitive interface for visualizing mazes.</br>
Built with modern software development principles, Pathfinder follows a [Clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) approach. It incorporates the [Repository](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-repository-pattern/) pattern and leverages the [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterbloccoreconcepts) state management library ðŸš€

## Architecture
Pathfinder fully adopts the Clean Architecture pattern, integrating both the Bloc and Repository patterns.</br> 
Clean Architecture is structured into the following layers: 
1) Data Layer
2) Domain Layer (Business Logic)
3) Presentation Layer (UI) </br></br>

Architecture for <b>API calls</b>:

## Features
- Enter an API endpoint to fetch maze challenges
- Solve mazes using the A-star algorithm for optimal pathfinding
- Verify the correctness of solutions by making requests to an API
- View correct path if the maze is solved correctly
- Select any maze to see its detailed solution, including start and end points
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction


<a name="supported-platforms"/></a>
